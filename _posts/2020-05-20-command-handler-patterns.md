# Command and CommandHandler patterns

A command is an object used to encapsulate all information needed to achieve an action. We will use this pattern to represent the user intents, and we will give them to the Command Handlers. A command handler is only a callable which will perform every action to complete the user intent.

There are two important rules to know. The first one: the command handler can only handle a single command because a use case cannot be handled in several ways. The second one: the command must be valid because the only command handler's responsibility is to handle the use cases and not to validate the commands.

Let’s take a simple example: an account creation. Our business expectations is that the users need to provide an email and a password to create an account. Users will be able to change their username whenever they want after the account creation.

We first need to create a command named `CreateAnAccount` which will represent the user intent:

```php
final class CreateAnAccount
{
   public string $accountIdentifier;
   public string $username;
   public string $password;
}
```

The command has three properties: `email`, `password` given by the user and the last one `accountIdentifier` generated by the application. We cannot use the username property as an identifier because it is mutable. The command is not really an object because it does not have any behavior but only a state. This is what we call a DTO (Data Transfer Object) and its only purpose is to encapsulate data and carry them to the command handler.

Then we need to create a command handler to handle this use case. It is callable, in our example, an invokable object. Its method should receive the valid command and it should return `void`. Then, we execute all actions needed to perform the use case thanks to the command's data.

```php
final class CreateAnAccountHandler
{
   private Accounts $accounts;

   public function __construct(Accounts $accounts)
   {
       $this->accounts = $accounts;
   }

   public function __invoke(CreateAnAccount $createAnAccount): void
   {
       $account = Account::create(
           $createAnAccount->accountIdentifier,
           $createAnAccount->username,
           $createAnAccount->password
       );

       $this->accounts->add($account);
   }
}
```

## Why are command properties public?

The properties are public because it eases the command creation thanks to libraries like Symfony Serializer component or Symfony Form component. They are able to easily map json or form data to an object which has the same properties. 

```php
 // Symfony serializer component
$createAccount = $this->serializer->deserialize(
      $request->getContent(),
      CreateAnAccount::class,
      'json'
);

 // Symfony form component
$form = $this->createForm(AccountType::class, new CreateAnAccount());
$form->handleRequest($request);
```

## Can we build a command through a constructor?

Yes for sure, if you don’t use any third party libraries which need public properties, please make your commands immutable. 

I’m used to adding a constructor even though my commands have public properties because it eases their creation for my acceptance tests because I don’t use the Symfony serializer. I don’t need to instantiate the command and then set every property manually.

**Caution:** If you use the Serializer or the Form component all constructor parameters must be optional because those libraries need to create it without giving any parameter.

## How to validate a command?

After the command creation, I use the Symfony validator to validate them but you are free to use your favorite library. If you are using a command bus don’t hesitate to create a middleware which automatically enables data validation. This feature is provided by Symfony messenger for instance.
